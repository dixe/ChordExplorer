# Commuinity driven chord "database"

## Frontend elm:
Create chord using chordpic(https://gitlab.com/Voellmy/chordpic)/svgGuitar(https://github.com/omnibrain/svguitar) or own chord creator tool

Good to use existing and integrate with it

Two main functions
1. Create new chord using choosen tool. Name it, tag it ect. and store it so others can find it

2. Browse other chords. Find by name, explore by tags.



### Future
Generate chord progressions by tag. Either random or given a key


OR


Make it a practice app
Be able to define practice "pieces" (rythm and tabs/chord)


Have users and be able to start and finish practices, and easily modify them
store those in db with all info like
* start
* stop
* order of pieces
* time on each


## Backend haskell plus postgres?
